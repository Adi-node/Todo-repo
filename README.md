## TODO Website
### Description
This is a simple Todo List application and my first ever Git repository. The app allows multiple users to create accounts and manage their own todo items. User data (username and password) and todos are stored in an in-memory object.

⚠️ Note: Since the data is stored in memory, it will be lost if the backend server crashes or is restarted.
### How to use
1. Start the server by running the following command in your terminal:

node index.js

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser to access the application.
